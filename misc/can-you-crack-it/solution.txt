# Solution: 
This is a hashcracking challenge (easy one).

## Step 1: 
The first step is to find out what hashtype it is, since we are mentioning domains and windows password hash, this should give you a clue that it is a NTLM hash.

## Step 2: 
Install hashcat on the host system, or passthrough a GPU to a VM with hashcat installed. 
It is important that hashcat gets as many resources ase possible to use so it will crack faster. 

## Step 3: 
Crack it using the following command

hashcat -m 1000 -a3 --increment --increment-min 5 --increment-max 10 3F0B3449E10E81C68088BDCB94BB607D ?a?a?a?a?a?a?a?a?a?a

Syntax breakdown:
-m 1000
Tells hashcat this is a NTLM hash

-a 3 
Method: Bruteforce

--increment
Try all combinations of a certain length before moving on

--increment-min 5
Start at 5 characters

--increment-max 10
Stop at 10 characters

3F0B3449E10E81C68088BDCB94BB607D 
NTLM hash

?a?a?a?a?a?a?a?a?a?a
Mask, ?a indicates one character with all combinations, uppercase, lowercase, digits, special characters. 
Giving ?a?a?a?a?a?a?a?a?a?a as a mask tels Hashcat to try all possible combinations up to 10 character long passwords. (with --increment)


## Step 4
Profit 
the clear text password is: U&!!Bl
HSCTF{U&!!Bl}
