### Difficulty
Easy (medium?). You need to extract puzzle pieces from the image and put them together to find the solution.

### Hint
- Examine the file in steganography tools like [Aperi'Solve](https://aperisolve.fr) or png-decoders such as [PNG file chunk inspector](https://www.nayuki.io/page/png-file-chunk-inspector). (They won't reveal the answer, but they will tell you that there is something funky at the end of the file warranting further investigation).
