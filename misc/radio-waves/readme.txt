Harrison heard about this cool program called Universal Radio Hacker. It’s supposed todecode RF protocols. To test things out he thought it would be fun to listen in on his neighbor’s wirelesssecurity system, but can’t seem to figure out why the data isn’t decoding properly. He took a spectrumcapture with GQRX to send the data to a friend. Can you help figure out what’s wrong?
