# Solution: 
This challenge has multiple steps where the first one is to find the key for XOR encryption before extracting the filesystem.

## Step1 Decryption: 
It is possible to find the key used for the XOR operation by hexdumping the encrypted file. 
Since the keylength is so much shorter than the file it self, the key will just repeat at the end when there is no more data to be encrypted. 

Run XXD and you will see the following Byte sequence at the end: 
8844 a2d1 68b4 5a2d

You can then decrypt with the following python script: 

```
#!/usr/bin/env python3
def xor(data, key):
    l = len(key)
    outfile_bytes = bytearray((
        (data[i] ^ key[i % l]) for i in range(0,len(data))
    ))
    xor_out = open("decrypted_firmware.bin", "wb")
    return xor_out.write(outfile_bytes)

data = bytearray(open('IC3116W_encrypted.bin', 'rb').read())

key = bytearray([0x88,0x44,0xa2,0xd1,0x68,0xb4,0x5a,0x2d])

xor(data,key)
```


## Step2 Finding the filesystem: 
After you have decrypted the firmware, you run the tool binwalk on the newly decrypted file. 
There you will see that at offset 1245312 there is a squashfs filesystem. 

This is the filesystem for the IP camera and it is what we want to extract. 

## Step3 Extracting the filesystem: 
Run the command binwalk -e to extract it and binwalk will do all the work. 
There will be created a new folder where you can go and look at the files. 

## Step 4 finding the Admin hash: 

The admin hash will be located in

/path to extracted_filesystem/squashfs-root/etc/passwd

There it will be one entry admin:$1$yAn92Ld/$u%nHFH9nLds0naDaLuK1d/:0:0:System Administrator,,,:/:/bin/sh

and the flag is HSCTF{$1$yAn92Ld/$u%nHFH9nLds0naDaLuK1d/}
